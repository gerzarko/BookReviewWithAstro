I decided to read this partly on the strength of another of the author’s biographies, that of Steve Jobs, which I read before joining GR and which I thought was fascinating. I was hoping this book would be as good but in the event I didn’t enjoy it as much. Looking at the other ratings, I seem to be in a minority, but I can only give my honest reaction.

I imagine most people interested enough to read a biography of Einstein will already be aware of his annus mirabilis of 1905, when he published a series of groundbreaking papers, each of which was hugely significant in the history of physics. He followed up about a decade later with his Theory of General Relativity. Physicists might find the book’s treatment of this period to be a bit thin, but I think Walter Isaacson was being careful not to get too deep into concepts that many of his readers would struggle to understand, and I count myself amongst that number. What I hadn’t known was that in subsequent decades Einstein became something of a scientific conservative who was unwilling to accept Quantum Mechanics, even though he acknowledged the evidence in favour of it. He also acknowledged that his later-life resistance to new concepts may have been a result of aging, and the general rule that older minds are less open to new ideas.

I’ve mentioned in other reviews that when reading a biography, I look for one that is both well-researched and well-balanced, and that is exactly what the author provides. Einstein’s personality, his family relations and his political beliefs are covered as well as his scientific work. One interesting feature was the extraordinary pop-star level of adulation he received in the 1920s during visits to the USA. One (pre-Nazi) German consul described it as “mass hysteria”. Isaacson suggests, with some justification I think, that Einstein’s appearance may have contributed to this.

“If he did not have that electrified halo of hair and those piercing eyes, would he still have become science’s preeminent poster boy?"

I also couldn’t stop laughing when Isaacson described how, when Einstein visited Washington DC in 1921:

“For reasons fathomable only by those who live in that capital, the Senate decided to debate the theory of relativity.”

Despite its merits, I have to say that I didn’t find the book the quickest read. Partly that was down to its length – 553 pages without the notes, but I also never found myself being drawn into reading about Einstein, and mostly read the book feeling quite detached. That was in contrast to my previous experience of Isaacson’s book about Steve Jobs. On the plus side, I do know a lot more about Einstein now.
